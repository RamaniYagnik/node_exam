where user can preform tasks like create, getAll, getSingleById, update By Id and delete By Id.After creating controller i created routes in that file i imported all functionality usin taskController.js and i created 
routes using express.Router and then i imported routes and connection file in the main App.js file.for creating this API i used express,dotenv,mongoose,Atlas Database and for testing i used POSTman
